## APIs Used

### 1. Pok√©mon TCG API (api.pokemontcg.io)

Dexsy primarily uses the [Pok√©mon TCG API](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/) to fetch card data. This is a RESTful API that provides comprehensive information about Pok√©mon cards.

**Endpoints Used:**

- `GET /v2/cards` - Search for cards with various filters
- `GET /v2/sets` - Retrieve information about card sets

**Key Query Parameters:**

- `q` - Search query with syntax like `name:"*Pikachu*"` or `set.id:"swsh1"`
- `page` - Page number for pagination
- `pageSize` - Number of results per page

**Example API Call:**
```javascript
fetch(`https://api.pokemontcg.io/v2/cards?q=name:"*Pikachu*"&page=1&pageSize=20`)
```

## How to Use the App

### 1. Search for Cards

The search box supports several search formats:
- Simple card name search: Just type the card name (e.g., "Charizard")
- Set ID search: Use # prefix (e.g., "#swsh1" for Sword & Shield base set)
- Set number search: Use # prefix with set ID and card number (e.g., "#swsh1-1")
- Set name search: Use @ prefix (e.g., "@Vivid Voltage")

2. The app will shuffle your deck and draw:
   - 7 cards for your hand
   - 6 cards for prizes

The application uses:
- Local storage for session persistence
- JSON file exports for deck saving
- Browser's fetch API for API calls
- CSS3 for responsive design and animations

## Notes

- Card prices are based on TCGPlayer market data embedded in the Pok√©mon TCG API

- Deck validation follows general Pok√©mon TCG rules but doesn't enforce all format-specific restrictions
